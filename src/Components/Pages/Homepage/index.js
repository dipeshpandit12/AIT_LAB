I am a tenure-track Assistant Professor of Civil Engineering program (Ingram School of Engineering) at Texas State University. Previously, I worked as an Associate Research Scientist at Texas A&amp;M Transportation Institute (TTI) for almost 7 years. I am still affiliated with TTI as a part time employee. I have more than 13 years of experience related to roadway safety, traffic operation, and CAV technologies. I am a Systems Engineer by training with hands on experience on Six Sigma and Lean Engineering. My major areas of expertise include database management, statistical analysis and machine learning with emphasis in safety and transportation operations, spatial analysis with modern web GIS tools, computer programming (R, python, VBA, html, and javascript), interactive data visualization, and deep learning tools for CV/AV technologies.</Text>
                    <Text textAlign="justify">I have published more than 120 technical reports, and journal articles. I am an active member of ITE, and ASCE. I am an Eno Fellow. I  recently served as vice-president of membership of Young Professionals in Transportation Houston chapter.</Text>
